## Package Design

This package serves as a single source of truth for shared resources in the Raster domain, following these key principles:
- **Centralization**: Eliminates code duplication across services
- **Type Safety**: Ensures consistent typing across the entire domain
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into clear sub-domains
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduces external dependencies for better maintainability
